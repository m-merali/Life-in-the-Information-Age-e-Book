	<h4 class="style2">Geographic </h4>
<p class="style1">Access to the world of information is also dependent on where 
you live. Geographical factor can also affect people and their lives and they 
how they behave towards the latest technology. Most of the time this affects 
people in the poorer countries but it can also affect the people in the richer 
countries for example people who live on the countryside may not have reliable 
Wi-Fi connection nor a good cellular connection restricting them from use such 
devices that may need a connection such services. This is because most of the 
service providers see no use of setting up a mast which sends and receives 
signals for only a few people and see it as a loss to set one up. To be able to 
get the best access to the information technology you must be living in the 
central areas of cities or the suburbs that surround these cities. Sometimes 
specific areas don&#39;t have their signals affected by other frequencies but don&#39;t 
have access to information technology but that is just because they may not have 
financial ability to set up networks in the area. Geographical location may 
influence a person&#39;s wealth or education. Wealthier families are more likely to 
have Internet access at home. Internet access also depends on which country you 
live in. Some countries have better communications links than others. There may 
be poor links in countries that have large areas with few people (eg deserts, 
mountains). The governments of some countries have schemes for education that 
involve providing hardware and Internet access for educational institutions as 
well as for communities. Schools, colleges and libraries may be connected to the 
Internet. The governments of poorer countries will not be able to do this. In 
the UK, some areas have access to broadband connections - some do not. In rural 
areas there may be fewer schemes for community access to the Internet 
(libraries, cyber cafes etc).</p>
