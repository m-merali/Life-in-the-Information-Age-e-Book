	<h2 class="auto-style10">FabFi</h2>
<p><span class="para">FabFi is an open-source, FabLab-grown system using common 
building materials and off-the-shelf electronics to transmit wireless ethernet 
signals across distances of up to several miles. With Fabfi, communities can 
build their own wireless networks to gain high-speed internet 
connectivity---thus enabling them to access online educational, medical, and 
other resources.(Source: fabfi.fablab.af)</span></p>

Their current project summary in Kenya (as of 5th October 2011)</h3>
<ul class="list" style="text-align: center;">
	<li class="auto-style15">They have deployed 50 remote FabFi nodes across three sites.</li>
	<li class="auto-style15">Longest link is 3500m</li>
	<li class="auto-style15">The system can provide connection speeds up to 30mbps and 
	greater</li>
	<li class="auto-style15">Provides direct Wi-Fi access to end-users</li>
	<li class="auto-style15">System integrates user accounting and management</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">Most people in the developing world such as Kenya find it very 
expensive to connect to the Internet due to low income rates. FabFi tackles this 
issue by using cheap and readily available materials i.e. appropriate technology 
to build a system that transmits ethernet signals at long ranges. With FabFi, 
wireless networks can be created among communities so that they can enjoy cheap 
and fast wireless Internet connection. As a result, from the law of demand, more 
and more people will connect to the Internet due its relative cheapness.This in 
turn, enables people to access tons of meaningful information which can help 
them improve their lives and make correct decisions. In conclusion, because of 
its affordability and quality, FabFi has been effective in bridging the divide.</p>
