<h3 class="auto-style3">Benefits</h3>
<ol class="list">
	<li>Access to information and communication technologies will enable 
	developing countries to increase their economic growth and empowerment</li>
	<li>Access to information will lead to increased education in developing countries. 
This will enable people of developing countries to carry out extensive research 
in science and technology and come up with new technologies which might benefit 
people or groups of people e.g. development of mobile software that would make 
it possible for farmers in rural areas to sell their agricultural products to 
buyers in the cities. This would save the farmers&#39; transport cost as they would 
not need to travel to cities to receive payments or make deals with buyers.</li>
	<li>It would help in building a closer relationship between the developing world and 
developed world</li>
	<li>It would enable developing countries to share their knowledge, culture and research and 
findings with the rest of the world&nbsp; hence building their global 
reputation.</li>
