</div>
<h4 class="auto-style5">Economic</h4>
<p class="para">The rich countries keep getting richer by taking advantage 
of e-commerce and e-business, since they can afford to buy IT equipment and have 
access to fast broadband connection. The poor countries on the other hand cannot 
afford to exploit the advantages of e-commerce and e-business since they are 
financially unable and have limited skills.</p>
<p class="para">In the developed world, development of ICT has created 
jobs for those who have specialized ICT skills such as communications engineer, 
computer programmer etc. However, in developing countries, ICT is used very 
little therefore there aren&#39;t many IT jobs available.</p>
<h4 class="auto-style5">Cultural</h4>
<p class="para">There are some countries that restrict/limit access to Internet 
because they think it goes against their religious and cultural beliefs. 
Examples of these countries include UAE (United Arab Emirates), North Korea and 
China.</p>
<h4 class="auto-style5">Education</h4>
<p class="para">In the developed world, almost all students have access to 
Internet either at school or at home. Those who don&#39;t have access to Internet in 
the developed world can visit local libraries . Students who have access to 
Internet can use it to carry out research on school/home work, watch educational 
videos and read insightful articles online. However, those students who don&#39;t 
have access to Internet will miss out the fruits of the Internet, and hence they 
may be forced to study using conventional methods.</p>
