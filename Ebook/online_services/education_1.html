<h2 class="subheader">Advantages Of Cloud Based Apps</h2>
<p class="style1"><strong>1. Flexibility</strong><br />
Cloud-based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating 
bandwidth demands. If your needs increase it’s easy to scale up your cloud 
capacity, drawing on the service’s remote servers. Likewise, if you need to 
scale down again, the flexibility is baked into the service</p>
<p class="style1"><br />
<strong>2. Work from anywhere</strong><br />
With cloud computing, if you’ve got an internet connection you can be at work. 
And with most serious cloud services offering mobile apps, you’re not restricted 
by which device you’ve got to hand.</p>
<p class="style1"><br />
<strong>3. Security</strong><br />
Lost laptops are a billion dollar business problem. And potentially greater than 
the loss of an expensive piece of kit is the loss of the sensitive data inside 
it. Cloud computing gives you greater security when this happens. Because your 
data is stored in the cloud, you can access it no matter what happens to your 
machine. And you can even remotely wipe data from lost laptops so it doesn’t get 
into the wrong hands.</p>
