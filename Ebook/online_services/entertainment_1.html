		also get to win a title of being the best in a certain online game.</td>
		<td class="auto-style6">Online gaming due to its addictive nature, acts 
		as a hindrance to school or office work and also in some cases affects 
		your social life. It draws you away from mandatory activities that are 
		beneficial to your life such as sports.</td>

<h3 class="auto-style9">None-Internet alternative</h3>
<p class="para">The far best non-Internet alternative to online gaming, 
especially in my local area is to go to a "Game zone". It is a place where 
people of all ages gather at a place (mostly a small shop) and play multiplayer 
games with each other on consoles such as Xbox, PS3 and PS2. It is more exciting 
since the environment is vibrant and also you get to be more social i.e. make 
new friends.</p>
<p class="para">Thanks to the Internet, we are now able to play games with 
different people around the world. The only problem that arises while playing 
games online is trying not to get glued to the screen (I know it's addictive). 
However, you can go about this by playing sports or carrying out other 
activities that deter you from playing online games.</p>
