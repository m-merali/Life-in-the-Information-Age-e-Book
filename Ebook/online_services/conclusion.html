<h1 class="header">Conclusion of online services</h1>
<p class="para">The advent of the Internet has been very beneficial to 
mankind. It has made everyday tasks enormously simpler. Imagine you were living 
in the 18th century and you wanted to send a Christmas card to your relatives 
who lived very far from your place(1000km away). At that time, it would have 
almost taken a week for the Christmas card to be delivered to your 
relatives(assuming everything went well along the way). In contrast to the 
current 21st century, due to desktop publishing and e-mail, it takes 10 minutes 
to prepare a Christmas card (this varies depending on how fast you type and 
design) and 2 minutes to send it to your relatives. Isn&#39;t that incredibly fast?</p>
<p class="para">Online services have improved efficiency of our lives. We save 
more time shopping online than visiting stores physically and standing in long 
queues just to buy few items. Online learning has also increased the literacy 
rates globally and has also been inspirational for people. It has encouraged 
people to self educate themselves so that they can earn a better paying job. The 
Internet has also made it possible for us to interact with the government at our 
finger tips. Finally, the Internet has enhanced our need for entertainment by 
making it easy for us to view movies, listen to music, play games etc.</p>
<p class="para">However, besides being beneficial, the Internet also has its 
dark sides. Hackers exploit the Internet to steal sensitive data from highly 
reputable companies. The data may be worth a great deal of fortune; which the 
companies cannot afford to loose.</p>
