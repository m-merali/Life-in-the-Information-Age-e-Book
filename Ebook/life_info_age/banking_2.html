<h3 class="auto-style7">How online shopping has changed our lives?</h3>
<p class="para">Constant connectivity, contextual relevance, and a multi-screen 
world are changing both online and offline shopping. As the digital and in-store 
experiences blur, it is opening up exciting new possibilities for 
forward-thinking retailers. Sridhar Ramaswamy, who as Google&#39;s SVP of Ads and 
Commerce oversees the technology behind Google Shopping, explains how combining 
classic retail truths with digital savvy can help retailers do what matters 
most: serve their customers better.<br />
Consumers no longer see a distinction between online and offline shopping. 
Whether it’s searching on a laptop, browsing main street shops or hanging out at 
the mall — it’s all shopping. To adapt to the competitive new reality, smart 
retailers are drawing on classic retailing truths of the past and augmenting 
them for the now. Online shopping has changed the lives of many people, for 
example, people live very busy lives especially those in the city and therefore 
they do not have time to go for shopping. So, online shopping is their only 
option. With online shopping, they can buy anything they want at anytime of the 
day, so if you arrived home late and didn&#39;t feel like cooking, you could order a 
pizza online and your dinner problem would be solved!. Did you see the power of 
online shopping?</p>
