<h2 class="life_info_age">Civil Rights</h2>
<p class="para">Civil rights affect everyone, they occur in a lot of the things 
you would do in your life.</p>
<p class="para">The main focus has been on I-d cards; they have been in the news 
frequently and have caused controversy because the government want the cards to 
identify terrorists and try to prevent crime. But some people feel that the 
cards would be taking away some of their rights, to them the cards label people 
taking away their identity.</p>
<p class="para">There is a lot of technology that has gone into the cards. To 
create an I-d card the owner needs to have a retinal scan, photo and finger 
prints taken. The card will have a lot of information including,</p>
<ul class="para">
	<li>Photo</li>
	<li>Finger prints</li>
	<li>Retinal scan</li>
	<li>Date of birth</li>
	<li>Family information</li>
	<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">To produce the cards the use of special techniques are necessary 
to prevent fakes to made and succeed in working as the real thing. If a fake 
works it makes the reason for making I-d cards a complete waste of time because 
people can say they are someone else and this means that someone could get away 
with carrying out a crime.</p>
