<h2 class="life_info_age">Communication</h2>
<p class="para">In the 21st century communication has greatly changed the lives 
of many people. Improvement in communication technologies has made it possible 
for us to communicate with people who live half-way across the world. Below are some statistics on communication:</p>
<h3 class="auto-style7">How Communication has changed my life?</h3>
<p class="para">Communication has greatly affected my life. Below I will list 
some examples of Communication and describe how they have affected my life.</p>
<ol class="auto-style7">
	<li><strong>Smart Phones:</strong> Smart Phones have become very powerful and, also the 
	operating system (such as IOS, Android) that they contain can 
	perform many meaningful tasks. I use a smart phone to mainly chat with my 
	friends and relatives on Facebook using the messenger app on Android and 
	make calls to my parents, friends and family. Sometimes I use the "WhatsApp" application on Android to text with my friends and relatives. I also 
	use a smart phone to view my emails. Without a smart phone, my life after 
	school hours would be very lonely.</li>
	<li><strong>Email:</strong> I mostly receive emails from websites I have subscribed to. 
	These websites include instructables.com, newscientist.com, mozilla.org etc. 
	The emails from these websites notify me of any updates hence keeping me 
	informed of all the events occurring on the Internet and in the world.</li>
	<li><strong>Skype:</strong> This is the most important tool of communication 
	in my life. I use Skype to make free calls to my relatives who live overseas 
	i.e. in places such as New Zealand and Canada. It saves me a lot of money 
	since the charges to make calls overseas in Kenya are very high. If it 
	wasn't for Skype, I wouldn't be able to keep in touch with my relatives who live 
	overseas. I also use Skype to discuss homework with my classmates. Skype is 
	truly, a savior when it comes to communication.</li>
