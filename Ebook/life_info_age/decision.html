<h3 class="auto-style6">How decision making has changed my life?</h3>
<p class="para">Recently, I had visited a sports store and I bumped into a pair 
of boots. I wanted to check whether the boot was an official product. But, unfortunately I couldn't, because the 
boot was completely sealed and the owner of the store wasn't helpful enough 
to let me open the seal. So, I googled the boot and I was 
linked to the official website of the company that had produced the boot. 
Surprisingly, the boot was for about $20 and that converted to Kenyan shillings 
is only 2000 but the store was selling the boot for 11000. So thanks to the Information 
Age I DECIDED not to buy the boot from the store as it was too expensive rather 
I bought it from the online store and saved allot of money.</p>
<p class="para">The above is a true real life example of how ICT affects the way 
we make decisions.</p>
